# ✍️ Description:
# This action is used to run eslint checks
# Runs on pull requests and pushes to the main/master branches
# Based on the event type:
#   - If it's a pull request, it will run eslint, then add the check to the PR as well as annotate the code with the errors and warnings.
#   - If it's a push to main/master, it will run the type checking and fail if there are any errors.
